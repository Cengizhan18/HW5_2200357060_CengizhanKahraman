This project demonstrates how Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be applied to a toy dataset that is not linearly separable. It compares the performance of linear and non-linear (RBF kernel) SVMs using scikit-learn.

Project Goals:
Generate synthetic 2D data that cannot be separated by a straight line.

Train and visualize a Linear SVM classifier.

Analyze the support vectors, margin, and misclassifications.

Train a non-linear SVM with an RBF kernel.

Visualize the decision boundary in 2D and 3D.

Highlight support vectors and explain results.

Compare the success of linear vs. non-linear models.
